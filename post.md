> In this post I am going to teach you 4 practical strategies that you can use in order to get your content quickly in front of an audience that is hungry for your content. These strategies are universal and can be used to promote any kind of content effectively for free.

## Overview

Alright, so you've created some content. You probably spent days or weeks researching, editing and getting it done. It is something you are proud of and now you want to share your work of prose with the world. In order to do that though, you need to find the people who are interested in consuming your content.

So where exactly do you start? In this post, the strategies we will cover are divided into two main types :

1. Active strategies
2. Passive strategies

The difference between the two types of strategies is that one requires active effort to engage people, while the other can be setup and left alone for the most part. In this post we will be covering 2 active strategies and 2 passive strategies each, with explanations on how to go about implementing each strategy.

The main purpose of the activities that follow is to help you maximize the opportunities for your content to be read by people within and outside your personal networks.

## 1. Active Strategies

## 1.1 Ask the people you know to share your content with their networks

A quick and easy way to get more eyeballs on your content right away is to have your friends, family and colleagues share your content with their immediate network. Sharing your content can be done through social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) or through email if they have a mailing list of potentially interested readers.

### 1.1.1 Share your content on Facebook

On Facebook you can ask if they'd be willing to share your content publicly with the people in their network, tagging people who they think would be most interested to read it. If they ask why you want to share your content, just tell the truth and say that you are trying to establish yourself as an expert in the topic relating to your content and you would like to reach as many people as possible. Most people won't have a problem with this if they believe your content is good, and being friends they'd be more than happy to help you out.

The point to remember with this strategy is that you want to leverage the reach and influence of people in your network who have followers that would be interested in your content. They could have alot of friends who are developers or be running a developer blog where they have a mailing list of tens, hundreds or even thousands of people.

### 1.1.2 Share your content through mailing lists

For friends who have mailing lists, these can be a good source of highly targeted readers. Always make sure to ask if they think your content would be a good fit for their audience. High quality mailing lists can take alot of time to grow, so site owners can be very protective when it comes to the content they put in front of their readers. If they agree, leave it to them to decide how best to share your link as they will generally know how best to approach exposing it to their readers.

## 1.2 Find groups and communities that could be interested in your content

The are alot of places online where you can find groups and communities who could be interested in your content. One of the best places though is through Facebook. With more than 1 billion people on Facebook, you would be doing yourself a huge disservice for not tapping into the traffic flow available through this social network.

### 1.2.1 Use Facebook Search To Find And Join Relevant Facebook Groups

Facebook search is the fastest and easiest way to find groups and online communities that may be interested in your content. There are 2 main types of groups that you will find, these being public groups and private groups. Every group has diffrent rules which can be clearly seen in their group descriptions, with private groups tending to be more strict with moderating outside links that can get posted to the public wall.

Some groups explicitly state that they will not accept posts or links to outside content, whilst others may state that they welcome any relevant content that adds to the conversation within the group. 

Either way, becoming part of groups that are relevant to your area of expertise is a great way to open up opportunities where you will be able to share your content with an audience which is already hungry for it. By contributing to the conversation within groups, opportunities to share your content as a means of responding effectively to a question will appear. 

### 1.2.2 Contact Moderators Directly To Ask For Permission To Post Links

If there is a community you would really like to get your content in front of, but because the rules of a group don't allow you to post links to their wall, you can personally get in touch with the moderator of the group to ask them if it is ok to share your content. If your content is very relevant to the conversation, in most cases moderators will give you permission. 

### 1.2.3 Get To Know Active Members In A Group

Another thing you can do is to get to know active members within a group. You will find that within groups, there are always a handful of members that are always either answering or posting questions. These are the people who you want to get to know as they tend to be people who are influencers among their personal networks as well. 

If you make an effort to offer solutions to questions posted by these influencers, these people will start to notice and acknowledge your expertise and helpfulness. After a few weeks, you might take the opportunity to ask them for feedback on content you have written. When you don't really know someone, asking for a review or feedback is a good way to break the ice, especially if know you have content that they'd be interested in.

If they think it is good, you can ask if they would be willing to share it with other developers in their network. People like to reciprocate when they feel someone has helped them, so be patient and make sure to give more than you ask for.

### 1.2.4 Link To Your Content When You Introduce Yourself To A Group

In some groups you are expected to introduce yourself when you join, and this presents you with an opportunity to share a relevant link, such as your personal website or content you have written. In your introduction you can identify your background and area of expertise in order to give people who see your personal introduction an incentive to click through your link.

An example of how you might word such an introduction is below:

=====

>Hi! my name is Jane and I am a web developer that specializes in front end javascript development and full stack Java web applications. I have 5 years of experience creating ecommerce web applications in java and have recently starting writing articles and tutorials to help other developers learn to do the same. My articles can be found through the link below for anyone who is interested in understanding how to build an ecommerce platform in Java. I look forward to helping out anyone I can as part of this group and also hope to learn from people who are more experienced than me. I'm hoping to learn more about full stack javascript application development, so if anyone knows much about this and has useful resources on the topic, please feel free to message me. Thanks for welcoming me and I look forward to being part of this awesome community!

=====

Now, for those of you are afraid of being labeled as a spammer by including a link in your first post, you can always approach the moderator personally and ask if it is ok for you to post a link to your content within your introduction. You can even send them the full draft of the introduction you plan to use so they can review it. Most people appreciate upfrontness, especially moderators who tend to have to deal frequently with inconsiderate spammers.

The great thing about groups is that they act as gathering points for people who are interested in specific types of knowledge. Find the groups that are interested in what you have to say, and take the time to gradually get your content in front of them.

## 2. Passive Strategies

## 2.1 Place links to your content in the about and profile pages of your social media and web properties

The principles outlined here work for any platform you have that has a dedicated section where you are able to write a brief description about yourself and include links.

When people search for your name in Google, the most common listings that tend to appear are social media profiles (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) and other web properties you might have such as a personal website, if your name is unique enough. 

In order to take advantage of this traffic from people who are actively searching for you and from people already in your network but are curious as to what you've been up to for the last few months, you want to place links to your content directly in the description/body of your profile or about pages.

Below is an example of what you could write so that it stays in context with the description about yourself.

=====
>I'm a software developer specializing in [insert languages and frameworks you are proficient in here]. I enjoy [ Insert list of hobbies and enjoyable past times here ]. I am also a writer and have authored content on AirPair where I am available for expert consulting for businesses and startups struggling with problems involving [list special knowledge super power here].

>GitHub

>...

=====

The above is just an example, but I think you get the gist of it. Put links to content you want to share in places where people tend to look in order to find more information about you and what you do.

## 2.2: Submit Your Content Links To Social Bookmarking News Sites

Submitting your link to social bookmarking news sites is a great way to get your content seen by a large number of people who could be interested in your content.

While there are many such sites out out there (Digg, Delicious), Reddit is the most popular and attracts a massive portion of internet traffic. It isn't called the front page of the internet for nothing, and if you can't get your link noticed here, it is highly unlikely to draw much or any attention on lesser known platforms.

While this doesn't mean you should ignore other sites, Reddit is a great place to get started if social bookmarking and link submission is new to you.

### 2.2.1 Submitting Your Link On Reddit

I am going to assume you have never used Reddit before and will be providing step by step instructions on how to submit a link on this platform.

To submit a link on Reddit, follow these steps :

1. Click the 'Submit a new link' button on the right side of the main page.
2. Create a new account.
3. Enter a title for your link - This can be the same as your content title.
4. Enter the complete link url of the content you want to submit.
5. Choose a subreddit - A subreddit is basically the category that best fits your content. For example, your content might be about javascript, and so you'd enter javascript as the subreddit.
6. Tick the option 'send replies to my inbox' so you can be notified if people comment.
7. Prove that you're human by entering the captcha.
8. Click the submit button.

There is a chance that when you complete this process, Reddit will tell you that 
your link has already previously been submitted. If it has been a long time since the link was last submitted, you will have the opportunity to resubmit this link.

Also, while it is ok to post links to your own content, a widely used rule of thumb on Reddit is that only 1 out of 10 of your posts should be to your own personal content. This is to encourage a diversity of content that gets submitted and also to discourage people from using the platform solely for promoting themselves. I'm pretty sure this rule applies to some degree on most social bookmarking news sites you will come across, so do keep it in mind.

Once you have submitted your link, you could just leave it and see how it goes, but I highly recommend you get into exploring the Reddit community. It is a great place to engage in conversations with people who might be interested in your content, and also to discover new ideas on topics you could potentially write about.

## Conclusion

While there are many more strategies I could share with you, I didn't want to overwhelm you with too much information. The above strategies are meant to introduce you to the fundamentals of 4 core content promotional strategies.

The key things to remember are that you want to maximize the reach of your content by taking advantage of the benefits of both active and passive strategies. Leverage your existing networks as much as possible and constantly seek opportunities to get your content in front of them and their networks. You also want to become part of the conversation in groups, forums and Q&A sites in order to find opportunities to put out your link, and to meet new connections who would be willing to share your content with their networks. Placing links to your content in strategic locations on your personal web properties helps capitalize on organic traffic and submiting your links to social bookmarking news sites ensures you aren't missing out on the traffic from communities that reside there.

Below is another quick recap of the 4 key strategies we have covered in this post :

####  Active Strategies
1. Ask people in your immediate network to share your content with their connections

2. Join and contribute to groups and communities that have members who would benefit from your content and expertise

#### Passive Strategies
1. Optimize your profile and about page descriptions to include links to your content

2. Submit your content links to social bookmarking and news sites
